<p>You want to learn to be a good programmer. Maybe you like solving problems. Maybe you get a thrill from creation. Maybe you like helping people. Maybe you’ve heard that being a programmer can be very profitable. Whatever the reason, you’ve been drawn to one of the most important and dynamic fields in today’s economy.</p>

<p>This program takes the position that being a programmer is about way more than code. If you set about to simply learn a programming language, you’re not learning all of the skills you are going to need to be successful in the long term. Here’s why:</p>

<ul><li><strong>There is no “Programming Language to Rule Them All”</strong> If you do this for more than about a year, you are going to run in to a need to use more than one language. Moreover, languages come and go, and the language you learn today may fall out of favor in a short amount of time. What you need to develop is the ability to think about problems outside of any language, then express it in the language that best matches the problems.</li><li><strong>This industry is constantly changing</strong> Technologies change, devices change, entire industry segments are created and destroyed at an astonishing rate. Because of this constant change, you need to be able to adapt. You need to:<ol><li>build a foundation on the most constant concepts, generic tools, most widely applicable knowledge you can and</li><li>really refine your ability to <em>learn all the time</em>.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Programming isn&#39;t about computers, it&#39;s about people</strong> You are in the business of solving problems for people. You may be solving them using software and computers, but your focus should always be on the person on the other end of your product. Sometimes that will be you. Sometimes that will be grandma. Do the extra work to make your product a work for a <em>person</em>.</li></ul>
